                        I'm a passionate, self-taught designer and developer who specializes in full stack development (React.js & Spring Boot). I care deeply about bringing both the <strong>technical and visual</strong> aspects of digital products to life â€” whether it's crafting a seamless user experience, fine-tuning pixel-perfect designs, or writing clean, performant, and maintainable code.

                        My journey into web development began in <strong>2018</strong>, driven by curiosity and a love for building things on the web. In <strong>2021</strong>, I took it a step further by formally studying <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> at university, where I continue to grow both academically and practically.

                        I'm a forward-thinking developer who enjoys working on products end-to-end â€” from ideation, design, to full-blown development and optimization. Whether itâ€™s a solo passion project or a team collaboration, I love building impactful web experiences.

                    <p>
                        When Iâ€™m not deep in code, youâ€™ll likely find me browsing Facebook, following the journey of early-stage startups, or just recharging. I often share tech tidbits and build in public â€” feel free to follow me on Twitter or explore my projects on GitHub.
